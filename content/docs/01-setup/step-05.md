## 5.1 Download

* Download **[SKSE64](http://skse.silverlock.org/)**. You need build ==**2.0.17**== for the current version of Skyrim SE.
* Save the downloaded archive to `Your Modding Folder\ARCHIVE\SKSE64`.

If on the main page for SKSE there is a different version number than the one noted above, Skyrim and the Script Extender were likely updated and you need to download the previous version from the archive page (see picture below).

## 5.2 Installation

### 5.2.1 Binaries

* Extract the archive’s contents to `Your Modding Folder\temp`.
* Move the following three files into your Skyrim SE **root** folder:
  * **skse64_**skyrim version number**.dll**
  * **skse64_loader.exe**
  * **skse64_steam_loader.dll**

### 5.2.2 Scripts

* Go back to your **temp** folder with the remaining files.
* Rename the **Data** folder to **SKSE – Data 2.0.x** (where x is the current version number).
* Move the new folder to `Mod Organizer 2\mods`.
* Switch back to Mod Organizer 2.
* Press F5 to refresh and the new mod will show up at the bottom of your mod order.
* Move it up below the **01 ESSENTIAL MODS** separator and activate it.
* Delete all remaining files inside your **temp** folder.

## 5.3 SKSE INI

* Download [SKSE64 INI PRE DOWNLOAD v1.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1651) from the Nexus (click "Mod Manager Download").
* Back to Mod Organizer 2, switch to the **Downloads** tab.
* Double-click the mod there and click **OK** to install it.
* Move it below **SKSE64 – Data v2.0.x** in the mod order and activate it.

> This will be the only time downloading and installing a mod through MO2 is explained. You will be expected to do this on your own from now on.

## 5.4 SKSE Launcher

* Restart Mod Organizer 2.
* The SKSE Launcher executable will now be automatically added to the executables list in MO2.
* Select **SKSE** in the list and click **Run**.

> At this point (and when testing later on) you’ll benefit a lot from having this page open on a secondary monitor or alternatively your phone or tablet in order to avoid having to tab out.

## 5.5 Verify Installation

* Once you are in the Skyrim SE main menu, bring up the console by pressing the tilde key on your keyboard (above TAB, next to 1).
* Type in ``getskseversion`` and hit Enter. It should return the version number of your SKSE64 installation.
* After confirming that SKSE64 was installed correctly, type **qqq** in the console and hit Enter to quickly close the game.
