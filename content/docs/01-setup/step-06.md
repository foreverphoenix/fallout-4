  Optimising the INI files with BethINI.

## 6.1 Generate Fresh INI Files

The basic game settings are saved in two INI files, **Skyrim.ini** and **SkyrimPrefs.ini**, and split up (somewhat arbitrarily) between them. In order to ensure that your INIs are completely untouched and vanilla, we will regenerate them before optimising them.

### 6.1.1 Remove old files

If you had Skyrim SE installed previously, follow these steps:

* Locate your default INI files in the following directory:
  * `C:\Users\{USERNAME}\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition`
* If you have old save games you wish to keep, back up the **saves** folder now.
* Delete everything inside the **Skyrim Special Edition** folder.

### 6.1.2 Generate new INIs

Continue with regenerating the INI files from scratch:

* Open Steam and find **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition** in your Game Library.
* Hit **Play** to open the regular launcher.
* A window will come up, informing you that Skyrim SE will now be configured based on your hardware.
* Click **OK** twice to confirm and hit **Exit** once it’s done.

## 6.2 Install BethINI

* Download the latest version of **[BethINI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4875)** manually from the Nexus.
* Extract the downloaded archive to `Your Modding Folder\Tools\BethINI`.
* Close Mod Organizer 2.
* Double-click **BethINI.exe**.

## 6.3 BethINI Configuration

### 6.3.1 BethINI - Setup

* After starting BethINI, you will be prompted with a window asking you to choose your game.
* Select **Skyrim Special Edition** from the drop-down menu.
* Once BethINI has loaded up, go to the first tab, **Setup**.
* All filepaths should be configured correctly out of the box, however it’s best to double-check:
  * **Game Path** should point at your **root** folder, `steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition`.
  * **Mod Organizer** should point at your MO2 folder, `{Your File Path}\Mod Organizer 2`.
  * **INI Path** should point at your MO2 profile: `ModOrganizer 2 > The Phoenix Flavour`.

> Changing the INI Path will prompt BethINI to restart. Click No when asked about using the skyrimcustom.ini file.

### 6.3.2 BethINI - Basic

Continue with the second tab, **Basic**.

- Set **Resolution** to the correct value for your monitor.
- Make sure to check **Recommended Tweaks**.
- **BethINI** presets should be toggled automatically.
- Select the **Medium** preset.
- Disable both **VSYNC** and **Lock Frame Rate**.

> Note that 1920x1080 is the recommended resolution. The performance impact of 1440p over 1080p is considerable.

### 6.3.3 BethINI - Interface

Continue with the fifth tab, **Interface**.

- Uncheck **Mod Manager Menu**. This will disable the menu entry leading to the Bethnet mods.
- **Dialogue Subtitles** and **General Subtitles** are unchecked by default, toggle them on if you need them.
- I prefer my **Lock Sensitivity** at `0.0450` but this will come down to personal taste and your mouse configuration.

> You can always turn the subtitles back on in the ingame settings.

### 6.3.4 BethINI - Detail

Continue with the sixth tab, **Detail**.

- **Water:** Check 'Reflect Objects' (object LOD reflections were fixed by SSE Engine Fixes).
- **Decal Quantity:** Set to `High`.
- **Godrays**: I recommend setting them to `None`, they don’t look great and eat frames for breakfast.
- **Field of View:** Increase this if you prefer a wider FoV.
- **Particles:** Set to `7500` (which is the recommended value for Complex Particle Lights, an ENB feature).
- **Lens Flare:** Matter of taste. Personally I disable this.
- **Anamorphic Lens Flare:** Looks ugly, recommended to be turned off.
- **Shadow Resolution:** Set to `2048` (unless your CPU is very slow).
- **Ambient Occlusion:** Uncheck this in favour of ENB AO.

### 6.3.5 BethINI - View Distance

Continue with the seventh tab, **View Distance**.

- **Grass Fade:** Set to `15000` or higher.

### 6.3.6 BethINI - Visuals

Continue with the eighth tab, **Visuals**.

- Set **Contrast** to `-0.1800`.

> This should eliminate the "black crush" some people are experiencing in Skyrim SE.

## 6.4 Save Changes

- Return to the second tab, **Basic**, and click `Save and Exit`.
- Restart Mod Organizer 2.
- You might be notified about the missing skyrimcustom.ini in which case you can just click **OK**.
